# 4800Pi

A major goal of this program is to have a small file size, even at the cost of
code readability, maintainability, and reliability. Pull requests that decrease
or keep the size the same will most likely be accepted, and pull requests that
increase its size will most likely be rejected. It's really that simple!

This repository has only been made with Linux in mind, but nothing special is
required in order to get a working build on Windows. The `sed` stuff in
`buildrun.sh` is only for trimming the output size.
